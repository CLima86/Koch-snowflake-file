# Koch Snowflake with Boundary and Interior Energies

This file contains files of Python code used to generate data points and plots of the Koch Snowflake
fractal with a Laplacian operator applied to the interior and boundary. Mathematica notebooks were 
used to generate plots seen in the publication https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04680 .

This project was initialized and completed during a summer research appointment at University of Connecticut
in the Department of Mathematics.

Research area: Mathematical Physics, Numerical Analysis, Fractal Analysis, Partial Differential Equations.
